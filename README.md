# push_swap

21.10.
It works atleast with certain values, but I need to make adjustments and possible additional function for find_index_in_a, as I might change the logic of pushing stuff back to stack A (to make it more efficient).

Goal for 22.10.:
- Adjust it so, that three number remain in stack A, and pushing stack B to A also applies the same efficiency-based logic as pushing stuff to stack B (calculating costs).

22.10.
I managed to reach my goal today, big sort and small sort are both effective enough. 

Goal for 23.10.:
- Start to add proper parsing, then make naming checks for functions, etc... to make everything as clear and easy-to-read as possible.

23.10.
Added parsing in case input contains strings (single or multiple) or unwanted characters (letters forexample). Error handling is still unfinished.

Goal for Thursday 24.10.:
- Finish error handling, modify main() into sub-functions and polish overall appearance.

Goal for Friday 25.10.
- Ready to submission, start evaluation process.
Goal for Sunday 27.10.
- Three peer-evaluations made
