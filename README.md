# push_swap

21.10.

It works atleast with certain values, but I need to make adjustments and possible additional function for find_index_in_a, as I might change the logic of pushing stuff back to stack A (to make it more efficient).

Goal for 22.10.:
- Adjust it so, that three number remain in stack A, and pushing stack B to A also applies the same efficiency-based logic as pushing stuff to stack B (calculating costs).
