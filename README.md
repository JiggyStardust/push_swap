# push_swap

21.10.

It works atleast with certain values, but I need to make adjustments and possible additional function for find_index_in_a, as I might change the logic of pushing stuff back to stack A (to make it more efficient).

Goal for 22.10.:
- Adjust it so, that three number remain in stack A, and pushing stack B to A also applies the same efficiency-based logic as pushing stuff to stack B (calculating costs).

22.10.

I managed to reach my goal today, big sort and small sort are both effective enough. 

Goal for 23.10.:
- Start to add proper parsing, then make naming checks for functions, etc... to make everything as clear and easy-to-read as possible.
